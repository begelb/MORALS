# MORALS with TL:  *Mo*rse Graph-aided discovery of *R*egions of *A*ttraction in a learned *L*atent *S*pace with Topological Loss

This repository is a fork of MORALS: https://github.com/Ewerton-Vieira/MORALS/tree/main written by Ewerton Vieira and Aravind Sivaramakrishnan.

The code from MORALS is combined with the topological autoencoders repository by the Borgwardt Lab: https://github.com/BorgwardtLab/topological-autoencoder. The topological autoencoder code was originally written by Michael Moor, Max Horn, and Bastian Rieck.
